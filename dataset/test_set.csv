It’s literally called being patient and waiting another day or two for funds to settle.

Not to mention, cryptocurrency is absolutely filled with scams. And the technology, blockchain, is outdated and stupid. Literally a unchangeable linked list… any programmer worth their salt can see that it’s basically useless old technology. It has some very tiny niche uses which largely, most corporations and governments don’t need it. And certainly they don’t need a cryptocurrency.

"I suspect that bitcoin WILL succeed, but for none of the reasons most people talk about.

Bitcoin DOES have an inherent value. Its inherent value stems from its distinct advantages: it is uncontrollable and easily launderable.

Bitcoin is the perfect underground currency. You can sell drugs with it. You can prostitute with it. You can sell murder with it. Bitcoins will have value, not because it has any inherent worth, but because it will be the only currency you can safely use to conduct illegal transactions.

Want BJ on the corner of FU and LAPD? Convert your dollars to bitcoins, pay in bitcoins, and presto: happy ending for you!

The value of the bitcoin will eventually be set by the flow of money through the currency in the pursuit of illicit goods. Let's say the daily illicit ""through transaction"" market is $100M. That means every day $100M worth of bitcoins are bought, used to purchase illicit goods and services, and then sold back into dollars. Thus, however many unique bitcoins happen to be on the market that day, they will in total be worth $100M.",1

"why I don't like crypto, ethically, financially and technologically:

proof of work mining (e.g. Bitcoin) wastes ungodly amounts of electricity (until the world is 100% renewables mining displaces more useful work and thus creates emissions) and computing capacity
proof of space is the same but for making the world a worse place by driving up storage costs for everybody
coin speculation is a massive ponzi scheme and no crypto fan acknowledges this
the e.g. bitcoin network throughput is ~dozens of qps which would merely be hilarious if it wasn't burning as much coal as Australia
just on pure waste: Bitcoin production is estimated to generate between 22 and 22.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year, or between the levels produced by Jordan and Sri Lanka, a 2019 study in scientific journal Joule found. (source) - ie this game is an entire additional country of environmental damage for ~no useful gain
no one has found an actual use for any of it except for online drug dealing (which requires niche coins since Bitcoin is massive distributed public ledger)
the level of market manipulation and accounting fraud by eg Tether (and now USD ""coin"" admitted lying about the backing) would normally send people to jail but has for some reason got a free pass
the clueless marketing by fanboys who only hope to enrich themselves by creating another layer to the pyramid
the endlessly stupid projects it has spawned where blockchain is seen as a solution to anything aside from the niche case of ""distributed tamper evident journal""
it has single handedly made mass international ransomware a viable business model by allowing a way to receive cash outside the banking system
the general enablement of all sorts of scams, e.g. the endless kids on this very subreddit promoting ""12% crypto savings accounts""
It isn't nearly as secure as people think it is. Any determined state actor could subvert the network.
Deflation isn't actually a good thing in a currency. It ultimately favours the wealthy who can hold and dont need to spend.
Mining (proof of stake or work) allow the wealthy to invest in mining equipment to control or dominate the market.
Ultimately, no government on earth is going to give up its monetary policy as that is a key lever of control.
essentially everyone involved at this point is just trying to hustle the next generation - any hope any of it would serve as a useful technological or financial system has gone)
the massive mis-represnetaion of how bitcoin in particular works, despite claims, it does not offer any of the following:
anonymity - the entire blockchain is public and diligently recorded on millions of nodes
distributed freedom - a small number of mining cartels control almost all the hash power and normal people use one of ten crypto currency exchanges for everything anyway
unencumbered transactions - it's comically slow and inefficient
convenient purchases - wallets are unwieldly for normal people, no reversibility
store of value - volatility is hilarious and all anyone cares about us BTC:USD
things I do like about cryptocurrency:

monero is pretty clever
ethereum smart contracts are pretty scifi
watching people learn 5000 years of history of why we have banking regulation in a single decade has been fun
there will be some massive financial catastrophes to watch that will mostly only harm people who did not read my previous list
the earlier state of every single exchange either getting robbed or exit scamming their own fanboys was quite funny in retrospect
(thx to u/TwentyCharactersShor for some extra items).

I used to just think cryptocurrency was a fun hack but a bad idea for the mainstream, but I'm now pretty convinced it should be banned purely on resource grounds, since it seems impossible to force the externalities to be addressed

It's possible that someone will invent a cryptocurrency that's efficient to a level that it's not morally reprehensible to use, but how would it take off? the existing cryptocurrency interests want bitcoin to succeed purely because they're the top of the pyramid and also selling the shovels and so now anything new has to compete aginst the real financial sector and the entrenched cryptocurrency players.",2

"DOT is the real deal with bank level security and stability.

It ensure DOT always runs smooth and never goes down or has security breaches. Most of the projects on DOT will also have a sister network on Kusama that will essentially do the same thing but will get new features and capabilities first. It’s also cheaper to use in general. Kusama is turning into an art and gaming hub because of this which is really cool. So moonriver/moonbeam, Karura/Acala, Heiko/Parallel, Khala/Phala, etc. are just the Kusama/DOT sister networks. Same teams building them, the Kusama versions will just have more features than the DOT versions.",1

"Wtf are you talking about? Those volatile stocks were among the largest market cap. They were the darlings of the pandemic. Companies like Netflix, PayPal, Meta, etc, aren't your random companies. They are in the S&P 500 and used to hold major shares in your common ETFs. These aren't some random outliers. When you look at the once top performers, that is not cherry-picking.

The people who are overleveraged in crypto are the same ones doing leverage in stocks. I don't understand why people want to single out crypto. A lot of volatility comes from overleveraged trading. The same suspects are driving the dump in both asset classes. Why deny that?",1

"Seriously, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here but how is this not apparent to everyone? And before crypto-bros come out of the woodwork and say that I don't understand crypto, I read the original whitepaper maybe a year or so after it came out and have kept reasonably well informed on crypto stuff since then.

Early days bitcoin was kind of interesting but it pretty quickly became apparent that it could never function as a consumer currency. If Bitcoin attempted to process even 1% of the transactions that AMEX does in a day it would take weeks to verify a transaction. So if it can't be used a a currency WTF is it? People started pointing out that gold is largely worthless except as an agreed store of value so they said 'well can't Bitcoin be that?' No, of course it can't. Gold has physical substance and the backing of nation states, it's value is protected by legal and social institutions. Yeah, all money is fake but Bitcoin is the fakest of all.

At the end of the day all crypto is worthless until you can find someone to trade you actual fiat currency for it, because it can't be used to fucking buy anything! That means that all crypto is just a 'bagholder' scam it works as long as the next idiot comes along to hold the bag. Fundamentally, it is no different from the holofoil comic book covers that almost destroyed the comics industry in the speculative bubble of the 90's, except there's a level of exposure the size of a small western European country. No party lasts forever, every bubble bursts, time is a flat fucking circle!",2
